<h1>World Macroeconomic Indicators</h1>
<h3> Analysis conducted of countries through the different macroeconomic indicators using SQL</h3>

<p>Welcome to my portfolio project on data analysis using Microsoft SQL! In this project, I have collected a vast amount of data from the World Bank's websites, focusing on critical indicators such as inflation, GDP, total reserves, total debts, and GNI of different countries.

Using my extensive knowledge of SQL, I have analyzed this data to provide valuable insights and draw useful conclusions. I used a variety of advanced SQL concepts, including common table expressions, window functions like rank, ntile, and lag, as well as pivot and unpivot operations.

By utilizing these powerful SQL techniques, I was able to analyze the data in a highly efficient and effective way, providing unique and valuable insights into the economic performance of different countries. This project is sure to catch the attention of anyone interested in data analysis, economics, or SQL, and offers a fascinating glimpse into the exciting world of data-driven decision-making.</p>
